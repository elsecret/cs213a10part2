People in general waited less in well_sem compared to well.
Semaphores allow for the "wake up" call to be pre-scheduled,
whereas if a thread blocked upon a cond_wait, the signal must come after.
This means, for X well drinks total, only X signals need to be sent, in the semaphore version.
In the non-semaphore version, at least in our implementation, there was a lot of wasted signaling
in order to protect the critical sections / prevent race conditions that resulted in deadlocks.
